Birthday Invitation HTML Code

This Basic HTML Project creates a simple birthday invitation webpage. It includes a heading, subheading, image, list of items to bring, and a Google Maps link to the location. Here is a breakdown of its main components:

Headings and Subheadings: The "h1 and h2" tags introduce the invitation with the date of the birthday.

Image: The "img" tag includes an image of a cake (placeholder "cake.jpeg") that enhances the visual appeal of the invitation.

List of Items: An unordered list "ul" lists essential items to bring, including balloons and cake.

Location Link: An "a" tag directs guests to the party location on Google Maps.
